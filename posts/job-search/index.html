<a class=heading-link href=#in-search-of-a-new-job><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true></i></a></h1><p>I began my search for my second full-time job during September of 2021. I knew that at my current position, I was not reaching my full potential in compensation (very underpaid) and decided I needed to do what was best to better provide for my family. The current landscape for finding a job seems to be quite rough, however, I have been fortunate in my recent search. I will detail more of the specifics in a later section. Compared to the many horror stories that can be found online from ghosting to terrible hiring processes to spammy recruiters, it really is a nightmare to find employment. I really hope that I can continue my current career trajectory and excel in any technical role that I am facing.</p><h2 id=what-i-value-in-a-job>What I value in a job
<a class=heading-link href=#what-i-value-in-a-job><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true></i></a></h2><p>Currently I have a few things that I value in a new job: technology, team, and compensation. For technology, it is important that I am working on and with something that is interesting, new, and/or fun. The team that I want is one that can collaberate, learn from each other, and keep things professional but still fun. And finally, the compensation is important because I (and everybody else) should earn what they deserve for the work and time provided.</p><h2 id=details>Details
<a class=heading-link href=#details><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true></i></a></h2><p>In this section I will provide some of the stats and timeline for my most recent job search.</p><p>I&mldr;</p><ul><li>Began applying on September 15, 2021</li><li>Applied to 45 job listings at 36 different companies</li><li>Have not received any information from 18, and had 20 auto rejections</li><li>Had 7 screening interview, 4 passed, 1 failed, 2 cancelled</li><li>Had 4 second round interviews, 3 passed, 1 position already filled</li><li>Withdrew from 1 process, and ended with 1 offer</li><li>Received my 1 offer on October 22, 2021</li><li>Accepted my 1 offer on November 1, 2021</li><li>Started new job on November 29, 2021</li></ul><p>The overall process took around 2 months, and in that time I was consistently watching videos and reading articles around interview preparations and strategy. And since I am in tech, I was grinding out some LeetCode.</p><p>Of the second round interviews I had there was&mldr;</p><ul><li>1 technical interview</li><li>1 CodeSignal challenge</li><li>2 project challenges</li></ul><p>For the technical interview, I felt like it went quite well; however, the role was filled shortly after. I passed the CodeSignal assessment and it was quite a different experience from a live technical interview. Of the 2 project challengs, I declined one and successfully completed the other. Unfortunately, the one I did pass, I was the second choice and did not receive an offer.</p><p>For the last company remaining, I had a final round interview consisting of 4 hours of different interviews. After that long day, I received news of an offer and I couldn&rsquo;t have been more excited!</p><p>I accepted and now I currently work at Capital One as a Data Engineer.</p></div><footer></footer></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
