As I continue to grow in my career, I continually find myself learning new things. At this current stage, I have begun to learn more about backend systems and microservice architecture. In order to facilitate this growth in understanding, I will be creating a fullstack banking application with a simple feature set with a focus on the backend aspects. The goals of this project include using Rust, gRPC, Docker, and a microservice architecture.
