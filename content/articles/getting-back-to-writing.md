Originally, I began my portfolio / blog site back in 2021 towards the beginning of my career. However, I only ever attempted to write a few times, as I was never really been one to put content out in the open. As I continue to grow in my career, I have began to realize how important it is to write things down. Not just ones thoughts, but also learn how to explain things clearly, such as technical documentation. This is when I stumbled upon the concept of the digital garden. And it made perfect sense. As I learn new things, explore new concepts, or just want to share some thoughts or ideas, I can write these down in a permenant way and allow my knowlege (or garden) to be shared to anyone who wants to see it. I see this as a win-win to both improve my written communication and allowing myself an outlet for sharing information that I have collected in my own voice.

So this begins the start of my digital garden. Similar to my physical garden at home that I have started, it begins small, but will continue to grow and flourish as long as I provide the proper attention. My hope is that I can continue to share my ideas and learnings at a consistent frequency.
