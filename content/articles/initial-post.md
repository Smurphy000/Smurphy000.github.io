# Welcome!

My name is Conner Murphy and I am a software/data engineer. I am will be using my personal website to also write some blog posts (mostly for my own benefit) to document my learning and research, but maybe you can get some value out of these posts as well!

## Direction

The current direction for this blog will about my continued learning in different programming languages such as:

- [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust): because it is strongly typed, low level, high performance, up-and-coming language for data engineering
- [Scala](https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty): because it is a functional, strongly typed, and jvm based language used in many big data technologies

Also, I will be doing experimentation and research with new packages/libraries in the data space including [Delta Lake](https://github.com/delta-io/delta), [Spark](https://github.com/apache/spark), [Datafusion](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion), and more!

Along with technical posts, I also hope to do some research on companies in the tech industry to gain more insights into what the future may hold.

If you like how all this sounds, then stick around! Also, feel free to reach out :)
