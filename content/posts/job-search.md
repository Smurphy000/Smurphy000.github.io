# In search of a new job

I began my search for my second full-time job during September of 2021. I knew that at my current position, I was not reaching my full potential in compensation (very underpaid) and decided I needed to do what was best to better provide for my family. The current landscape for finding a job seems to be quite rough, however, I have been fortunate in my recent search. I will detail more of the specifics in a later section. Compared to the many horror stories that can be found online from ghosting to terrible hiring processes to spammy recruiters, it really is a nightmare to find employment. I really hope that I can continue my current career trajectory and excel in any technical role that I am facing.

## What I value in a job

Currently I have a few things that I value in a new job: technology, team, and compensation. For technology, it is important that I am working on and with something that is interesting, new, and/or fun. The team that I want is one that can collaberate, learn from each other, and keep things professional but still fun. And finally, the compensation is important because I (and everybody else) should earn what they deserve for the work and time provided.

## Details

In this section I will provide some of the stats and timeline for my most recent job search.

I...

- Began applying on September 15, 2021
- Applied to 45 job listings at 36 different companies
- Have not received any information from 18, and had 20 auto rejections
- Had 7 screening interview, 4 passed, 1 failed, 2 cancelled
- Had 4 second round interviews, 3 passed, 1 position already filled
- Withdrew from 1 process, and ended with 1 offer
- Received my 1 offer on October 22, 2021
- Accepted my 1 offer on November 1, 2021
- Started new job on November 29, 2021

The overall process took around 2 months, and in that time I was consistently watching videos and reading articles around interview preparations and strategy. And since I am in tech, I was grinding out some LeetCode.

Of the second round interviews I had there was...

- 1 technical interview
- 1 CodeSignal challenge
- 2 project challenges

For the technical interview, I felt like it went quite well; however, the role was filled shortly after. I passed the CodeSignal assessment and it was quite a different experience from a live technical interview. Of the 2 project challengs, I declined one and successfully completed the other. Unfortunately, the one I did pass, I was the second choice and did not receive an offer.

For the last company remaining, I had a final round interview consisting of 4 hours of different interviews. After that long day, I received news of an offer and I couldn't have been more excited!

I accepted and now I currently work at Capital One as a Data Engineer.
